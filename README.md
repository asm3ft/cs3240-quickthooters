### quicktHOOters 
Welcome to QuicktHOOter, a web application specific to the University of Virginia that serves as an "Uber for Tutors." Upon logging in with a Google account, students can submit a request for a subject or problem they need help with, include their location and any other relevant information. Tutors, once logged in, can browse requests and select any they deem relevant to their skillset. Confirmation emails will be sent to both parties. 
## You can view this application on our [Heroku Site](https://quick-thooters.herokuapp.com).

### Basic Use
## Login
Login using the "login" button; it will prompt you to use any current Google account you own.

## Update Profile
Navigate to your profile using either the sidebar or the nav bar at the top of the page. Update your profile to include your major, year, and a photo if you’d like. 

## Make a Request
Return to the home page by clicking on the icon of the student and computer in the nav bar. Click on the “Start Learning” button to open a new tutoring request. You should receive a confirmation email that your request was submitted, and can view your current requests via your sidebar.

## Accept a Request
Click on the “Start Tutoring” button to accept a tutoring request; the user who submitted this request will receive a confirmation email that their request was accepted.
